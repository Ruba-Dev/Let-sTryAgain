<h1>This is an html learner!</h1>
<p>I am coding an <b>html file</b> as I was told to do so. Doing that feels really <i>great;)</i> The only thing i miss
    is that  there is no body told me how to attach this file to my app or even to my web page.
    I don't know java script . I only know some java :))</p>
